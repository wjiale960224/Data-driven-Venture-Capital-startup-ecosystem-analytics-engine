## Client vision

Main Sequence Ventures manages the $240 million Innovation fund on behalf of the Australian Government, CSIRO and the private sector. It aims to inject funds into rising Australian startups that have the potential to expand to global-scale businesses, in deep tech fields including space technology, quantum computing, life science and machine learning. In pursuit of this goal, Main Sequence encounters a problem.

Our client shared her concern about the current inefficient data analysis tool. She demanded a more user-friendly and customized tool for real-time portfolio tracking and extracting insights to facilitate future investments. After discussion, we outlined the following objectives:

1. Build a website presenting an interactive dashboard for portfolio tracking and decision making. The dashboard should be able to clearly visualise key statistics, facilitate time series analysis, convenient comparisons between startups.
2. Implement a database management system linked to the website, that can process small-scale data provided by the client.
3. *Stretch*: Build a simple machine learning model that can predict potentially rising startups, contributing to client's future investment decisions.
4. *Stretch*: Generalise the tool for non-Australian or non-tech startups.

## Rules

1. **Team decision**: Members contribute ideas, then we discuss as a team. Regarding any conflicts or disagreements, we will vote for the final decision. If there is further conflict, we will elevate the issue to tutor or course convenor.
2. **Team conflict**: Potential problems can arise due to the remote nature of this semester. Since it is impossible to arrange face-to face team meetings, it is difficult to keep the entire team at the same pace. We set up a WeChat group to notify each other of the ongoing process. We can make any discussions in the groupchat at a timely manner as well. In case no solution can be reached within the team, we would notify the Course Convenor through email as soon as possible. 
3. **Task distribution**: Task will be distributed evenly and according to members’ specialties. Tasks are distributed with a clearly defined dealine, normally 3 days before the hard deadline to facilitate team review. Everyone’s work should be reviewed by at least one other team member to ensure work quality.
4. **Deadline penalty**: No penalty for valid reasons such as sickness. However, delay in work accomplishment may lead to extra tasks in the next project stage. Free riders will be reported to the convener immediately. 
5. **Collaboration**: Members are expected to collaborate with each other actively, communicate professionally and timely.
