## Client vision

Main Sequence Ventures manages the $240 million Innovation fund on behalf of the Australian Government, CSIRO and the private sector. It aims to inject funds into rising Australian startups that have the potential to expand to global-scale businesses, in deep tech fields including space technology, quantum computing, life science and machine learning. In pursuit of this goal, Main Sequence encounters a problem.

Our client shared her concern about the current inefficient data analysis tool. She demanded a more user-friendly and customized tool for real-time portfolio tracking and extracting insights to facilitate future investments. After discussion, we outlined the following objectives:

1. Build a website presenting an interactive dashboard for portfolio tracking and decision making. The dashboard should be able to clearly visualise key statistics, facilitate time series analysis, convenient comparisons between startups.
2. Implement a database management system linked to the website, that can process small-scale data provided by the client.
3. *Stretch*: Build a simple machine learning model that can predict potentially rising startups, contributing to client's future investment decisions.
4. *Stretch*: Generalise the tool for non-Australian or non-tech startups.

## Rules

1. **Team decision**: Members will first state their own point, then we discuss it as a team. Regarding any conflicts or disagreements, we will vote for the final decision. If there is further conflict, we will elevate the issue to tutor or course convenor.
2. **Team conflict**: Potential problems will be mainly remote issues for this special semester. Since it is impossible to arrange any face-to face meetings within the team, it is difficult to keep the entire team at the same pace. We set up a WeChat group to notify each other of the ongoing process. We can make any discussions in the group at a timely manner as well. In case there is no solution can be found within the team, we would notify the Course Convenor through email as soon as possible. 
3. **Task distribution**: Task will be distributed evenly and according to members’ specialty. Tasks deadlines are set when they are distributed, normally 3 days before the hard deadline to allow time for team review. Everyone’s work should be reviewed by at least one other team member to ensure work quality.
4. **Deadline penalty**: No penalty for valid reasons such as sickness. However, late for group work accomplishment may need to do extra tasks at the next project stage. Free riders will be reported to the convener immediately. 
5. **Collaboration**: Each member is expected to collaborate with each other and communicate professionally.
